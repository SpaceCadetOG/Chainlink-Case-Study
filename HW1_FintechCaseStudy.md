## Chainlink Case Study

## Overview and Origin

* Name of company
Chainlink Labs

* When was the company incorporated?
Jan 1, 2014

* Who are the founders of the company?
Sergey Nazarov, Steve Ellis, and Ari Juels 

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?
Chainlink connects smart contracts to different data feeds that are off-chain, While maintaining the security and reliability guarantees inherent to blockchain technology.

These can be price feeds: payment provider, weather data, asset data, medical data, and other blockchains.

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?
Company was funded with an ICO, and later gave out a utility token that is trade on crypto exchanges. 



## Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?
Because Smart contracts can't talk to off-chain data from the blockchain, the gather off-chain data to the blockchain. They also have offered more to hybrid smart contract which may become new standard.

Highly Secure and flexible infrastructure : 

    Reliable, Tamper-proof network - Use decentralization, trusted nodes, premium data, and cryptographic proofs to connect highly accurate and available data/APIs to any smart contract.

    Seamless connection to any API - Build on a flexible framework that can retrieve data from any API, connect with your existing systems, and integrate with any blockchain, now and in the future.

    Proven, time-tested solutions - Integrate battle-hardened and time-tested oracle solutions that secure billions of dollars in value for market-leading blockchain projects.

    Transparent oracle computation - Independently monitor and verify Chainlink’s open-source code, the performance of its oracle networks, and the quality of individual node operators.


* Who is the company's intended customer?
Anyone with plans to use data in their smart contracts. 

* Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? 
Chainlink is the leader of the oracle space. They offer many oppopnites to anyone who wants to put data up. They are the most trusted DEFI app.

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)
Because they were the first, they pretty much the leaders in this space, said previously. Pretty much every DeFi Protocol is intergated and also on most blockchains.

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)
Blockchain : Ethereum (EVM), Solidity, Python, NodeJS, Truffle, Brownie, 
Cloud: AWS, GCP, AZure, Networking, CI/CD, Docker
Data: ML, Data mining

## Landscape:

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in?
Cryptocurrency, Blockchain, Data Analytics, and Machine Learning

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5-10 years?
On-chain randomness:
    Numerous blockchain games use a cryptographically secure and provably fair source of on-chain randomness.

Connect your smart contract to real-world data and events: 
    Connect with any API and perform any off-chain computation opens up a wide variety of use cases.

Easy blockchain adoption for enterprises:
    Enterprises and governments with numerous ways to leverage the benefits of blockchain technology without redesigning their current systems.

* What are the opportunities created in this domain?
Data Provider: 
    Sell data through existing APIs to the Chainlink Network in less than an hour. Data providers to monetize their existing infrastructure and focus solely on providing quality data.

Node Operater:
    Node operators are the backbone of the Chainlink Network, running and maintaining oracle infrastructure that ensures smart contracts across every blockchain have secure access to the highest quality real-world data.


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far?
The most trusted oracle network in DeFi:
    
    Chainlink Price Feeds provide critical market data needed to issue, settle, and secure DeFi applications, The Chainlink Network supports a multitude of price feeds live in production, securing billions in value for many leading DeFi applications, CeFi companies, and various other financial institutions.



* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics?
This is an open-source ecosystem. Chainlink is driven by a large open-source community of data providers, node operators, smart contract developers, researchers, security auditors, and more.

Extensive monitoring of your oracles:
    Numerous protocols are built using transparency and full visibility for the price feeds and the teams participating in them. This gives you confidence that the feeds are reporting properly at all times.

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain?
The most trusted oracle network in DeFi:

Derivatives:
    Blockchain-based derivatives platforms require the price of real-world assets in order to provide reliable on-chain valuations. Use Chainlink reference contracts to mint synthetic assets, settle futures contracts, or price options.

Lending and borrowing:
    Lending and borrowing platforms require a price feed to ensure the total value of the collateral. Use Chainlink to issue and settle loans, liquidate collateral, and calculate interest payments.

Stablecoins:
    Stablecoins require a price feed to assert the value of the underlying collateral backing the asset. Use Chainlink to create stablecoins pegged to fiat currency, currency baskets, or commodities.

Asset management:
    Asset management platforms require a reliable price feed for critical rebalancing of asset ratios. Use Chainlink to enhance a DEX, adjust capital pools, or facilitate multiple forms of payment.


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

They are connected to the Ethereum price so with them being cross-chain, their token price can get out of order. Just trust their own oracle system can work. 

I Really cant say. They are ahead of the curve when it comes to technology in general. They are truly a sleeping giant.
